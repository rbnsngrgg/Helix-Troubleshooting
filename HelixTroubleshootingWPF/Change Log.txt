3.0.0
	-Sensor testing function to check and display the expected on-board files for Evo and Solo sensors.
	-Tab in the sensor testing window to display key information from the sensor.xml.
	-Fixture data gathering tab in the sensor testing window to show the fixture results for a sensor.
		-A serial number can be input manually.
		-When the sensor test is run on a connected sensor, the fixture data is gathered for that sensor automatically.
	-Config updates
		-Added fixture log file locations in Helix_Troubleshooting_Config > Directories > FixtureResults.
		-Added "SensorTest" node with "sensorIp" attribute.
		-Adjusted config file loading for future backward compatibility.

2.0.0
	-Refactor to C#/WPF
	-Improvements to algorithm errors fix and temperature adjust.
	-Added functions for gathering Evo sensor fixture data.

1.0.2
	-Included laser line exposure value in the line analysis summary.

1.0.1
	-Fixed a bug that caused Laser Line Analysis for 916-0401-XXXX sensors to return "None" due to the rotated images (Issue 7).

1.0.0
	-GUI redone to have a list of available functions that, when selected, give brief instructions on how and why they are used.
	-Added Functions:
		-Solo laser line analysis. Gives CG data, line width, focus scores, average CG locations, line angle, and pixel data.
		-Temperature adjust function for Evo t-comp files. User inputs serial number and desired reference cycle average temperature. Temp column is adjusted and original is backed up.
	-Icon added.

0.2.0
	-All functions that handle files have been moved to TTools module.
	-Functions have been redone and streamlined for:
		-Restoring Tcomp files
		-Fixing ALS points
		-Creating illuminated sphere summaries
	-Functions have been added for:
		-Fixing algorithm errors in tcomp files
		-Removing staring dots from laser line (TZ) images
	-GUI has been redone and simplified

0.1.2
	-Included SN991XXX sensors in functionality.
	-Fixed a bug in handling incorrect serial number entries for illuminated sphere gathering.
	-Fixed T-comp injection to work with the file structure of the thermal test results folder on castor.
	-Storing all directories into one pickle file, instead of 4. Also improved loading/writing of the file.
	-Changing a directory no longer requires restarting the software.
	-Added image distances for illuminated spheres for remaining models.

0.1.1
	-Initial build
