3.4.1
	--Properly dispose of system tray icon on closing.

3.4.0
	--Added further automation to t-comp template generation.
		"Apply TComp Template" allows the user to enter a serial number and number of months, then have the template applied automatically, as well as logged for tracking purposes.
	--Fixed a bug with illuminated sphere summary that caused crashing due to tiff tag 37374.
	--Improved the performance of illuminated sphere sumamry by promptly disposing of images when they're no longer needed.

3.3.0
	--Added function to create "R" part number config files for Evo and Solo sensors, based on configs that are present for non-R part numbers.
	--Applied alsSensitivity config variable, where the function previously explicitly defined "3".
	--.NET 5 Framework-dependent, Portable.

3.2.3
	-Improvement for the staring dot removal function.
		-The staring dot bounding box is found only using 0-degree images, as the dots appear brighter in these images.
		-Added configurable parameters for minimum intensity, x scan percentage, and y scan percentage.
			-X and Y scan percentage determine how many pixels on each axis to exclude when searching for a staring dot.

3.2.2
	-Fixed bug that caused a crash due to tiff tag 37374
	-Added configurable option to only allow one instance of the application to run.

3.2.1
	-Adjusted formatting of Evo Performance Reports.
	-Added messagebox upon completion of report generation.

3.2.0
	-Added feature to generate Evo Performance Reports, to be used in lieu of the reports generated by HelixRect.
	-HelixTroubleshooting can now be configured to start minimized.
	-Added functionality to gather additional sensor information from log files and configs.

3.1.0
	-Added feature to generate a t-comp template for Evo sensors.
	-Fixed a bug that caused ImageMagick objects to pile up in memory during staring dot removal. (Issue 19)
	-Added function to get an Evo sensor's after thermal rectification results. Not implemented in GUI.
	-Fixed a typo that caused EvoSensorsFromUff and EvoSensorsFromPitch to attempt to grab data from the LPF log.

3.0.0
	-Sensor testing function to check and display the expected on-board files for Evo and Solo sensors.
	-Tab in the sensor testing window to display key information from the sensor.xml.
	-Fixture data gathering tab in the sensor testing window to show the fixture results for a sensor.
		-A serial number can be input manually.
		-When the sensor test is run on a connected sensor, the fixture data is gathered for that sensor automatically.
	-Config updates
		-Added fixture log file locations in Helix_Troubleshooting_Config > Directories > FixtureResults.
		-Added "SensorTest" node with "sensorIp" attribute.
		-Adjusted config file loading for future backward compatibility.

2.0.0
	-Refactor to C#/WPF
	-Improvements to algorithm errors fix and temperature adjust.
	-Added functions for gathering Evo sensor fixture data.

1.0.2
	-Included laser line exposure value in the line analysis summary.

1.0.1
	-Fixed a bug that caused Laser Line Analysis for 916-0401-XXXX sensors to return "None" due to the rotated images (Issue 7).

1.0.0
	-GUI redone to have a list of available functions that, when selected, give brief instructions on how and why they are used.
	-Added Functions:
		-Solo laser line analysis. Gives CG data, line width, focus scores, average CG locations, line angle, and pixel data.
		-Temperature adjust function for Evo t-comp files. User inputs serial number and desired reference cycle average temperature. Temp column is adjusted and original is backed up.
	-Icon added.

0.2.0
	-All functions that handle files have been moved to TTools module.
	-Functions have been redone and streamlined for:
		-Restoring Tcomp files
		-Fixing ALS points
		-Creating illuminated sphere summaries
	-Functions have been added for:
		-Fixing algorithm errors in tcomp files
		-Removing staring dots from laser line (TZ) images
	-GUI has been redone and simplified

0.1.2
	-Included SN991XXX sensors in functionality.
	-Fixed a bug in handling incorrect serial number entries for illuminated sphere gathering.
	-Fixed T-comp injection to work with the file structure of the thermal test results folder on castor.
	-Storing all directories into one pickle file, instead of 4. Also improved loading/writing of the file.
	-Changing a directory no longer requires restarting the software.
	-Added image distances for illuminated spheres for remaining models.

0.1.1
	-Initial build
