-Initial build

0.1.2
-Included SN991XXX sensors in functionality.
-Fixed a bug in handling incorrect serial number entries for illuminated sphere gathering.
-Fixed T-comp injection to work with the file structure of the thermal test results folder on castor.
-Storing all directories into one pickle file, instead of 4. Also improved loading/writing of the file.
-Changing a directory no longer requires restarting the software.
-Added image distances for illuminated spheres for remaining models.

0.2.0
-All functions that handle files have been moved to TTools module.
-Functions have been redone and streamlined for:
	-Restoring Tcomp files
	-Fixing ALS points
	-Creating illuminated sphere summaries
-Functions have been added for:
	-Fixing algorithm errors in tcomp files
	-Removing staring dots from laser line (TZ) images
-GUI has been redone and simplified

1.0.0
-GUI redone to have a list of available functions that, when selected, give brief instructions on how and why they are used.
-Added Functions:
	-Solo laser line analysis. Gives CG data, line width, focus scores, average CG locations, line angle, and pixel data.
	-Temperature adjust function for Evo t-comp files. User inputs serial number and desired reference cycle average temperature. Temp column is adjusted and original is backed up.
-Icon added.

1.0.1
-Fixed a bug that caused Laser Line Analysis for 916-0401-XXXX sensors to return "None" due to the rotated images (Issue 7).

1.0.2
-Included laser line exposure value in the line analysis summary.
